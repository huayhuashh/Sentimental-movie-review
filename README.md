## Sentimental movie review
Classify movie reviews from IMDB using neural nets and sentiment analysis techniques in PyTorch. Go one step further to find improved signal by reducing the noise in the dataset.

Starting point
The Jupyter Notebook is available in the repo. This provides you a step-by-step guide to build a neural network to predict sentiment from movie reviews.

Step 1: Load and explore the dataset
Step 2: Develop a predictive theory for sentiment analysis
Step 3: Transform text into numbers
Step 4: Building a neural network
Step 5: Strengthen the neural network by reducing the noise in the vocabulary
Step 6: Explore clusters of similar words in predicting sentiment
Note: You can see the rendered output of the Jupyter Notebook directly by clicking [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/huayhuashh/Sentimental-movie-review/blob/master/Sentimental-movie-review.ipynb).

Next steps
This is only a starting point – feel encouraged to develop this code even further.
