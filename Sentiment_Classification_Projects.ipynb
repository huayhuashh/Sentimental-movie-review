A perfectly neutral word – one that was used in exactly the same number of positive reviews as negative reviews – would be almost exactly 1. The `+1` we suggested you add to the denominator slightly biases words toward negative, but it won't matter because it will be a tiny bias and later we'll be ignoring words that are too close to neutral anyway.\n",

A very positive word like \"amazing\" has a value above 4, whereas a very negative word like \"terrible\" has a value around 0.18. Those values aren't easy to compare for a couple of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Right now, 1 is considered neutral, but the absolute value of the postive-to-negative rations of very postive words is larger than the absolute value of the ratios for the very negative words. So there is no way to directly compare two numbers and see if one word conveys the same magnitude of positive sentiment as another word conveys negative sentiment. So we should center all the values around neutral so the absolute value from neutral of the postive-to-negative ratio for a word would indicate how much sentiment (positive or negative) that word conveys.\n",
    "* When comparing absolute values it's easier to do that around zero than one. \n",
